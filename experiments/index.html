                        <p>Each experiment should have an assay file describing the samples and the images of them.
                        In this file, each image should have its own row, and it is almost like a time line,
                        with the starting sample described first (left hand side of the row) and then moving
                        through treatments to the sample (referencing the protocol names described in study file),
                        then the imaging assay, then the data analysis and finally listing the file with the results
                        in it.  In more detail, working from left to right the row for each image should contain:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sample information (e.g. species, cell line, genotype, organism part),</li>
                            <li>growth, treatment (if applicable), and image acquisition protocols should be listed, </li>
                            <li>assay name.  Assay names are for each imaging ‘assay' but there may be several images
                                from an assay, e.g. several images from the same slide or organism part, in which case
                                they should all be given the same assay name to group them together.  </li>
                            <li>Experimental conditions.  Experimental conditions are any important variables
                                in the experiment e.g. were the cells treated with different compounds, the
                                protein targeted for labeling varies, or the organism part is different in each image. </li>
                            <li>Dataset name.  This is usually the same as the assay name, but if you want to
                                give it a different ‘display name' in the image repository you can specify it here.</li>
                            <li>Image File Path – the path to the file on the file system (starting from the
                                folder which contains all the image files)</li>
                            <li>Image File name – the exact name of the image file</li>
                            <li>Channels – the label and what it targets, separated by a colon. Each pair of labels
                                and visualized object is separated by a semi-colon. E.g. DAPI:nuclei;TRITC:HA_Flag
                                tagged protein.</li>
                            <li>Data processing protocols – list the name of the data analysis protocol described
                                in the study file.</li>
                            <li>Processed data – the name of the file containing the processed data/summary results.</li>
                            <li>Comment[] columns can be added at any point and values in the square brackets
                                created as needed (although IDR curators may edit the values so that they are similar
                                across different studies) e.g. Comment [Image File Type] to say if the file is a raw

                        to the study, library and processed files in the repository but you don't need
